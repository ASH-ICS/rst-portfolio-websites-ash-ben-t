<h3>Yukon Government Under Fire For Holds Renewable Energy</h3>

<p>People are criticizing the Yukon government for silently putting a hold on the renewable energy rebate program until the spring. "We're just getting started, and the program's been a great success. And just to sort of put it on pause right now is a real head-shaker," said Mitt Stehlin, a certified energy assessor in Whitehorse.</p>
  <p>The government says they need to put a pause on this project because they said they needed to study renewable resources.</p>
<p>Under the territory's micro-generation program, Yukoners connected to the electrical grid who install solar or another renewable energy system on a site can receive an annual reimbursement for any surplus energy fed into the grid.</p>
<p>The government didn't publicly notify residents of the change in tack.</p>
<p>A territorial government spokesperson told CBC News in a written statement that the program was being put on hold in Whitehorse and the surrounding area until at least the end of May 2024, to study "the impact of adding additional variable renewable energy to the Yukon's main grid."</p>
<p>Stehlin says he doesn't get why a pause is necessary. He says since the program was introduced, there's been a "flood of people" installing solar panels at home.</p>
<p>"We had energy audit emergencies — people were in such a rush to get the solar panels up that we were overwhelmed for about two years," Stehlin said.</p>
<p>"You've had industry ramp up in order to meet the demand and now all of a sudden you're going to leave them high and dry for six months? I think that's the bigger impact, in my mind."</p>
<p>Stehlin says even with that growing demand, solar still makes up a small percentage of the power produced in the Yukon — so he has a hard time seeing why the impact needs to be assessed through a study.</p>
<p>"I could certainly see it if we're looking at a larger percentage being produced," he said.</p>
<p>MLA Scott Kent of the opposition Yukon Party is frustrated at the government's lack of transparency.</p>
<p>"We would have hoped to see a government news release on something like this so that those individuals in the private sector that install or do the energy audits would have a better idea of what was going on," Kent said.</p>
<p>"The one thing that we're certain of is the uncertainty that they've created."</p>
