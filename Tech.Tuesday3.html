<h3>Amazon A.I truck inspection technology</h3>
 <body style="background-color:lightgoldenrodyellow;">
<p>The Amazon delivery company recently installed a new A.I to make their lives easier. Amazon recently installed an A.I that inspects the delivery trucks for physical damage and alerts to fix it. This type of technology is called automated truck inspection. When the delivery truck makes all of its deliveries, it goes back to the warehouse. The truck then drives through the scanners and the camera creates a 3D model of the truck on the computer. The scanners can scan the undercarriage of the trucks, it can also check tire quality, and can find small cracks in the windshield. The algorithm of the scanners should pick up every big or minor inconvenience of the truck. 
  The Amazon company said that they have been testing these A.I scanners for roughly two years. There's only a couple of these A.I scanners in some Amazon warehouses. But in the next couple of years they plan to install more of these scanners in Canada, US, UK, and Germany. </p>
