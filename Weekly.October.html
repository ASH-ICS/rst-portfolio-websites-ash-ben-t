<p>This week we got to do a CMU project. The project was halloween themed and it had to have mouse events in it. This was also a partner activity. I was partners with Isabelle. Our project was a ghost spotter. You clicked on the screen and a ghost appears. The amount of ghosts you see makes the ghost spotter goes up by one.</p>
