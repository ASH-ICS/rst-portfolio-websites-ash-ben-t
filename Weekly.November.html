<h3>Weekly November</h3>
<h3>Nov 6-Nov 9</h3>
<p>This week was a short week because friday is a board holiday. This week was remeberence day. We got to code poppies in CMU. We were suppose to have a quiz on CMU on thursday but due to the assembly, the quiz was cut short. I also finished my creative task on CMU. It was Kirby pumping up a balloon.</p>
<h3>Nov 13-Nov 17</h3>
<p>This week we programmed a rock, paper scissors ai machine that lets users take pictures of their hands to play rock, paper, scissors. The machine is programmed to win everytime. It's basically a scam. We also has a cmu quiz on friday.</p>
