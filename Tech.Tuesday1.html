<h1>How hackers are using bluetooth to track police activities</h1>
</html> Bluetooth is used for connecting and communicating with other devices without the use of wires and cables. But how can it negatively impact people if not carefully protected and carefully used? It can lead hackers to connect to the bluetooth and listen to other people's activity. Which is why this tech Tuesday is sponsored by NordVPN… Just kidding, I’m not important enough to get sponsored by anything.</html>

</html>The article talks about how bluetooth is used widely among the police force. They use bluetooth to connect to speakers at the station from speakers in the police car, to walkie talkies used by police men. For example, using bluetooth can reveal a lot of information about where cops are and what they’re currently doing, like when their body cams are recording or they turn on the sirens to respond to a call there's the signal that is sent when a police officer basically thinks something's recording worthy. The app will collect data. In the case of body cams, if the device begins recording, it typically sends a Bluetooth signal out to other devices. If a cop turns on a camera someone running the app could collect this data to record details about the incident.</html>

</html>The reason why cops use bluetooth is that it makes the graphics more clear. By using bluetooth, its connectivity helps with guaranteeing that incidents are captured on camera and the devices are connected to maximize visibility and to understand the graphics more clearly. But, this can also be used negatively because hackers can connect to the cops bluetooth if they are in close contact with each other. This can help the hacker get their hands on important information. This isn’t only harmful for cops but for people as well. This can be harmful for people because people can often trade credit card numbers with the bank or share private and personal information. Hackers can use bluetooth ( if the person is on bluetooth) and can steal that information which can be very bad.</html>

</html>In summary, by using bluetooth it can fall into the wrong hands and use it to track sensitive information.</html>
